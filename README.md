## Javascript/React Assignment: React Calculator

For this assignment, you will use your knowledge of HTML(JSX), Javascript, and React to
create a fully functional calculator application.  You have been provided with a
React/Javascript/HTML shell containing some basic code and instructions to get you
started. Some buttons and Javascript have already been written as examples for you to follow.  
You must complete the program by adding more buttons with Javascript functionality in
a React format.  

# Quick Tips

1. Remember the proper way to use/connect event listeners and functions in a React format.  
2. Google will be an important resource for individual button functionality creation.
3. There is some simple math involved.  Try to think of the most logical ways to get a
button to do what you want.
4. It is always important to understand data flow and the overall goal of your application.  
First, read through the program shell and instructions to get a general idea of what you
will need to do, and how each piece of data/value, in this case state, is will be used to
calculate simple math problems.
5. You have been provided with a CSS file as well.  Since CSS is not the primary focus of
this assignment, the file has been completely preprogrammed for you.  But remember to make
sure that corresponding ID and classNames are correct.
6. If you do not remember how to clone and start an application, please refer to past
assignment instructions regarding this task.
